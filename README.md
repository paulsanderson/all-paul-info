# allpaul.info
This repository holds the code for the static website [www.allpaul.info](www.allpaul.info), which is the personal homepage for Paul Sanderson.

It is built using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/). It is hosted on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). It is a work in progress, largely built from scratch, and is partly intended to just be a fun excuse to learn and showcase skills. A photo gallery is the current priority.
